    "    (mult5 << add) 10 \n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "## Currying\n",
    "\n",
    "If you remember from Part 3, the reason that we were having problems composing mult5 and add (in ) is because mult5 takes 1 parameter and add takes 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can solve this easily by just restricting all functions to take only 1 parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Trust me. It’s not as bad as it sounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "We simply write an add function that uses 2 parameters but only takes 1 parameter at a time. Curried functions allow us to do this.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Curried Function is a function that only takes a single parameter at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will let us give add its first parameter before we compose it with mult5. Then when mult5AfterAdd10 is called, add will get its second parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Javascript, we can accomplish this by rewriting add:\n",
    "```\n",
    "var add = x => y => x + y\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This version of add is a function that takes one parameter now and then another one later.\n",
    "\n",
    "In detail, the add function takes a single parameter, x, and returns a function that takes a single parameter, y, which will ultimately return the result of adding x and y.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can use this version of add to build a working version of mult5AfterAdd10:\n",
    "```\n",
    "var compose = (f, g) => x => f(g(x));\n",
    "var mult5AfterAdd10 = compose(mult5, add(10));\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The compose function takes 2 parameters, f and g. Then it returns a function that takes 1 parameter, x, which when called will apply f after g to x.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what did we do exactly? Well, we converted our plain old add function into a curried version. This made add more flexible since the first parameter, 10, can be passed to it up front and the final parameter will be passed when mult5AfterAdd10 is called.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, you may be wondering how to rewrite the add function in Elm. Turns out, you don’t have to. In Elm and other Functional Languages, all functions are curried automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the add function looks the same:\n",
    "```\n",
    "add x y =\n",
    "    x + y\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is how mult5AfterAdd10 should have been written back in Part 3:\n",
    "```\n",
    "mult5AfterAdd10 =\n",
    "    (mult5 << add 10)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntactically speaking, Elm beats Imperative Languages like Javascript because it’s been optimized for Functional things like currying and composition.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Currying and Refactoring\n",
    "\n",
    "Another time currying shines is during refactoring when you create a generalized version of a function with lots of parameters and then use it to create specialized versions with fewer parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, when we have the following functions that put brackets and double brackets around strings:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "bracket str =\n",
    "    \"{\" ++ str ++ \"}\"\n",
    "doubleBracket str =\n",
    "    \"{{\" ++ str ++ \"}}\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s how we’d use it:\n",
    "```\n",
    "bracketedJoe =\n",
    "    bracket \"Joe\"\n",
    "doubleBracketedJoe =\n",
    "    doubleBracket \"Joe\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can generalize bracket and doubleBracket:\n",
    "```\n",
    "generalBracket prefix str suffix =\n",
    "    prefix ++ str ++ suffix\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "But now every time we use generalBracket we have to pass in the brackets:\n",
    "```\n",
    "bracketedJoe =\n",
    "    generalBracket \"{\" \"Joe\" \"}\"\n",
    "doubleBracketedJoe =\n",
    "    generalBracket \"{{\" \"Joe\" \"}}\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "What we really want is the best of both worlds.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we reorder the parameters of generalBracket, we can create bracket and doubleBracket by leveraging the fact that functions are curried:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "generalBracket prefix suffix str =\n",
    "    prefix ++ str ++ suffix\n",
    "bracket =\n",
    "    generalBracket \"{\" \"}\"\n",
    "doubleBracket =\n",
    "    generalBracket \"{{\" \"}}\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that by putting the parameters that were most likely to be static first, i.e. prefix and suffix, and putting the parameters that were most likely to change last, i.e. str, we can easily create specialized versions of generalBracket.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameter order is important to fully leverage currying.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, notice that bracket and doubleBracket are written in point-free notation, i.e. the str parameter is implied. Both bracket and doubleBracket are functions waiting for their final parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can use it just like before:\n",
    "```\n",
    "bracketedJoe =\n",
    "    bracket \"Joe\"\n",
    "doubleBracketedJoe =\n",
    "    doubleBracket \"Joe\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "But this time we’re using a generalized curried function, generalBracket.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Common Functional Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s look at 3 common functions that are used in Functional Languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "But first, let’s look at the following Javascript code:\n",
    "```\n",
    "for (var i = 0; i < something.length; ++i) {\n",
    "    // do stuff\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There’s one major thing wrong with this code. It’s not a bug. The problem is that this code is boilerplate code, i.e. code that is written over and over again.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you code in Imperative Languages like Java, C#, Javascript, PHP, Python, etc., you’ll find yourself writing this boilerplate code more than any other.\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s what’s wrong with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "So let’s kill it. Let’s put it in a function (or a couple of functions) and never write a for-loop again. Well, almost never; at least until we move to a Functional Language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s start with modifying an array called things:\n",
    "```\n",
    "var things = [1, 2, 3, 4];\n",
    "for (var i = 0; i < things.length; ++i) {\n",
    "    things[i] = things[i] * 10; // MUTATION ALERT !!!!\n",
    "}\n",
    "print(things); // [10, 20, 30, 40]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### UGH!! Mutability!\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s try that again. This time we won’t mutate things:\n",
    "```\n",
    "var things = [1, 2, 3, 4];\n",
    "var newThings = [];\n",
    "for (var i = 0; i < things.length; ++i) {\n",
    "    newThings[i] = things[i] * 10;\n",
    "}\n",
    "print(newThings); // [10, 20, 30, 40]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, so we didn’t mutate things but technically we mutated newThings. For now, we’re going to overlook this. We are in \n",
    "Javascript after all. Once we move to a Functional Language, we won’t be able to mutate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The point here is to understand how these functions work and help us to reduce noise in our code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s take this code and put it in a function. We’re going to call our first common function map since it maps each value in the old array to new values in the new array:\n",
    "```\n",
    "var map = (f, array) => {\n",
    "    var newArray = [];\n",
    "    for (var i = 0; i < array.length; ++i) {\n",
    "        newArray[i] = f(array[i]);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    return newArray;\n",
    "};\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice the function, f, is passed in so that our map function can do anything we want to each item of the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can call rewrite our previous code to use map:\n",
    "```\n",
    "var things = [1, 2, 3, 4];\n",
    "var newThings = map(v => v * 10, things);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Look ma. No for-loops. And much easier to read and therefore reason about.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, technically, there are for-loops in the map function. But at least we don’t have to write that boilerplate code anymore.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let’s write another common function to filter things from an array:\n",
    "```\n",
    "var filter = (pred, array) => {\n",
    "    var newArray = [];\n",
    "for (var i = 0; i < array.length; ++i) {\n",
    "        if (pred(array[i]))\n",
    "            newArray[newArray.length] = array[i];\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    return newArray;\n",
    "};\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice how the predicate function, pred, returns TRUE if we keep the item or FALSE if we toss it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s how to use filter to filter odd numbers:\n",
    "```\n",
    "var isOdd = x => x % 2 !== 0;\n",
    "var numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n",
    "var oddNumbers = filter(isOdd, numbers);\n",
    "print(oddNumbers); // [1, 3, 5]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Using our new filter function is so much simpler than hand-coding it with a for-loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final common function is called reduce. Typically, it’s used to take a list and reduce it to a single value but it can actually do so much more.\n",
    "\n",
    "This function is usually called fold in Functional Languages.\n",
    "```\n",
    "var reduce = (f, start, array) => {\n",
    "    var acc = start;\n",
    "    for (var i = 0; i < array.length; ++i)\n",
    "        acc = f(array[i], acc); // f() takes 2 parameters\n",
    "    return acc;\n",
    "});\n",
    "```\n",
    "The reduce function takes a reduction function, f, an initial start value and an array.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the reduction function, f, takes 2 parameters, the current item of the array, and the accumulator, acc. It will use these parameters to produce a new accumulator each iteration. The accumulator from the final iteration is returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example will help us understand how it works:\n",
    "```\n",
    "var add = (x, y) => x + y;\n",
    "var values = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n",
    "var sumOfValues = reduce(add, 0, values);\n",
    "print(sumOfValues); // 15\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the add function takes 2 parameters and adds them. Our reduce function expects a function that takes 2 parameters so they work well together.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start with a start value of zero and pass in our array, values, to be summed. Inside the reduce function, the sum is accumulated as it iterates over values. The final accumulated value is returned as sumOfValues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these functions, map, filter and reduce let us do common manipulation operations on arrays without having to write boilerplate for-loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "But in Functional Languages, they are even more useful since there are no loop constructs just recursion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Iteration functions aren’t just extremely helpful. They’re necessary.\n",

    "## Execution Order\n",
    "\n",
    "Most programs are single-threaded, i.e. one and only one piece of code is being executed at a time. Even if you have a multithreaded program, most of the threads are blocked waiting for I/O to complete, e.g. file, network, etc.\n",

    "While this sounds crazy, it’s not as chaotic as it sounds. Let’s look at some Elm code to illustrate this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "buildMessage message value =\n",
    "    let\n",
    "        upperMessage =\n",
    "            String.toUpper message\n",
    "        quotedValue =\n",
    "            \"'\" ++ value \"'\"\n",
    "    in\n",
    "        upperMessage ++ \": \" ++ value\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here buildMessage takes message and value then produces an uppercased message, a colon and value in single quotes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice how upperMessage and quotedValue are independent. How do we know this?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 2 things that must be true for independence. First, they must be pure functions. This is important because they must not be affected by the execution of the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "If they were not pure, then we could never know that they’re independent. In that case, we’d have to rely on the order that they were called in the program to determine their execution order. This is how all Imperative Languages work.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second thing that must be true for independence is that the output of one function is not used as the input of the other. If this was the case, then we’d have to wait for one to finish before starting the second.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, upperMessage and quotedValue are both pure and neither requires the output of the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, these 2 functions can be executed in ANY ORDER.\n",
    "\n",
    "The compiler can make this determination without any help from the programmer. This is only possible in a Pure  Functional Language because it’s very difficult, if not impossible, to determine the ramifications of side-effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "The order of execution in a Pure Functional Language can be determined by the compiler.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is extremely advantageous considering that CPUs are not getting faster. Instead, manufactures are adding more and more cores. This means that code can execute in parallel at the hardware level.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, with Imperative Languages, we cannot take full advantage of these cores except at a very coarse level. \n",
    "\n",
    "But to do so requires drastically changing the architecture of our programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "With Pure Functional Languages, we have the potential to take advantage of the CPU cores at a fine grained level automatically without changing a single line of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Type Annotations\n",
    "\n",
    "In Statically Typed Languages, types are defined inline. Here’s some Java code to illustrate:\n",
    "```\n",
    "public static String quote(String str) {\n",
    "    return \"'\" + str + \"'\";\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice how the typing is inline with the function definition. It gets even worse when you have generics:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "private final Map<Integer, String> getPerson(Map<String, String> people, Integer personId) {\n",
    "   // ...\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "I’ve bolded the types which makes them stand out but they still interfere with the function definition. You have to read it carefully to find the names of the variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "With Dynamically Typed Languages, this is not a problem. In Javascript, we can write code like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "var getPerson = function(people, personId) {\n",
    "    // ...\n",
    "};\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is so much easier to read without all of that nasty type information getting in the way. The only problem is that we give up the safety of typing. We could easily pass in these parameters backwards, i.e. a Number for people and an \n",
    "Object for personId.\n",
    "\n",
    "We wouldn’t find out until the program executed, which could be months after we put it into production. This would not be the case in Java since it wouldn’t compile.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what if we could have the best of both worlds. The syntactical simplicity of Javascript with the safety of Java.\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that we can. Here’s a function in Elm with Type Annotations:\n",
    "```\n",
    "add : Int -> Int -> Int\n",
    "add x y =\n",
    "    x + y\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice how the type information is on a separate line. This separation makes a world of difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you may think that the type annotation has a typo. I know I did when I first saw it. I thought that the first -> should be a comma. But there’s no typo.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you see it with the implied parentheses it makes a bit more sense:\n",
    "```\n",
    "add : Int -> (Int -> Int)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This says that add is a function that takes a single parameter of type Int and returns a function that takes a single parameter Int and returns an Int.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s another type annotation with the implied parentheses shown:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "doSomething : String -> (Int -> (String -> String))\n",
    "doSomething prefix value suffix =\n",
    "    prefix ++ (toString value) ++ suffix\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This says that doSomething is a function that takes a single parameter of type String and returns a function that takes a single parameter of type Int and returns a function that takes a single parameter of type String and returns a String.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice how everything takes a single parameter. That’s because every function is curried in Elm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since parentheses are always implied to the right, they are not necessary. So we can simply write:\n",
    "```\n",
    "doSomething : String -> Int -> String -> String\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Parentheses are necessary when we pass functions as parameters. Without them, the type annotation would be ambiguous. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "takes2Params : Int -> Int -> String\n",
    "takes2Params num1 num2 =\n",
    "    -- do something\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "is very different from:\n",
    "```\n",
    "takes1Param : (Int -> Int) -> String\n",
    "takes1Param f =\n",
    "    -- do something\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "takes2Param is a function that requires 2 parameters, an Int and another Int. Whereas, takes1Param requires 1 parameters a function that takes an Int and another Int.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s the type annotation for map:\n",
    "```\n",
    "map : (a -> b) -> List a -> List b\n",
    "map f list =\n",
    "    // ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here parentheses are required because f is of type (a -> b), i.e. a function that takes a single parameter of type a and returns something of type b.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here type a is any type. When a type is uppercased, it’s an explicit type, e.g. String. When a type is lowercased, it can be any type. Here a can be String but it could also be Int.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you see (a -> a) then that says that the input type and the output type MUST be the same. It doesn’t matter what they are but they must match.\n",
    "\n",
    "But in the case of map, we have (a -> b). That means that it CAN return a different type but it COULD also return the same type.\n",
    "\n",
    "But once the type for a is determined, a must be that type for the whole signature. For example, if a is Int and b is String then the signature is equivalent to:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "(Int -> String) -> List Int -> List String\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here all of the a’s have been replaced with Int and all of the b’s have been replaced with String.\n",
    "\n",
    "The List Int type means that a list contains Ints and List String means that a list contains Strings. If you’ve used generics in Java or other languages then this concept should be familiar.\n",

    "## Now What?\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you’ve learned all this great new stuff, you’re probably thinking, “Now what? How can I use this in my everyday programming?”\n",
    "\n",
    "It depends. If you can program in a Pure Functional Language like Elm or Haskell, then you can leverage all of these ideas. And these languages make it easy to do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you can only program in an Imperative Language like Javascript, as many of us must, then you can still use a lot of what you’ve learned but there will be a great deal more discipline required.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Functional Javascript\n",
    "\n",
    "Javascript has many features that let you program in a more functional manner. It’s not pure but you can get some immutability in the language and even more with libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s not ideal, but if you have to use it, then why not gain some of the benefits of a Functional Language?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Immutability\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing to consider is immutability. In ES2015, or ES6 as it was called, there is a new keyword called const. \n",
    "\n",
    "This means that once a variable is set, it cannot be reset:\n",
    "```\n",
    "const a = 1;\n",
    "a = 2; // this will throw a TypeError in Chrome, Firefox or Node\n",
    "       // but not in Safari (circa 10/2016)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here a is defined to be a constant and therefore cannot be changed once set. This is why a = 2 throws an exception (except for Safari).\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem with const in Javascript is that it doesn’t go far enough. The following example illustrates its limits:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "const a = {\n",
    "    x: 1,\n",
    "    y: 2\n",
    "};\n",
    "a.x = 2; // NO EXCEPTION!\n",
    "a = {}; // this will throw a TypeError\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice how a.x = 2 does NOT throw an exception. The only thing that’s immutable with the const keyword is the variable a. Anything that a points to can be mutated.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is terribly disappointing because it would have made Javascript so much better.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how do we get immutability in Javascript?\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, we can only do so via a library called Immutable.js. This may give us better immutability but sadly, it does so in a way that makes our code look more like Java than Javascript.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Currying and Composition\n",
    "\n",
    "Earlier in this series, we learned how to write functions that are curried. Here’s a more complex example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "const f = a => b => c => d => a + b + c + d\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that we had to write the currying part by hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "And to call f, we have to write:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "print(f(1)(2)(3)(4)); // prints 10\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "But that’s enough parentheses to make a Lisp programmer cry.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many libraries which make this process easier. My favorite one is Ramda.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Ramda we can now write:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "const f = R.curry((a, b, c, d) => a + b + c + d);\n",
    "print(f(1, 2, 3, 4)); // prints 10\n",
    "print(f(1, 2)(3, 4)); // also prints 10\n",
    "print(f(1)(2)(3, 4)); // also prints 10\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The function definition isn’t much better but we’ve eliminated the need for all those parenthesis. Notice that we can apply as many or as few parameters as we want each time we invoke f.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using Ramda, we can rewrite the mult5AfterAdd10 function from Part 3 and Part 4:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "const add = R.curry((x, y) => x + y);\n",
    "const mult5 = value => value * 5;\n",
    "const mult5AfterAdd10 = R.compose(mult5, add(10));\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that Ramda has a lot of helper functions for doing these sorts of things, e.g. R.add and R.multiply, which means we can write less code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "const mult5AfterAdd10 = R.compose(R.multiply(5), R.add(10));\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Map, Filter and Reduce\n",
    "\n",
    "Ramda also has its own versions of map, filter and reduce. Although these functions exist in Array.prototype in vanilla Javascript, Ramda’s versions are curried:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "const isOdd = R.flip(R.modulo)(2);\n",
    "const onlyOdd = R.filter(isOdd);\n",
    "const isEven = R.complement(isOdd);\n",
    "const onlyEven = R.filter(isEven);\n",
    "const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8];\n",
    "print(onlyEven(numbers)); // prints [2, 4, 6, 8]\n",
    "print(onlyOdd(numbers)); // prints [1, 3, 5, 7]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "R.modulo takes 2 parameters. The first is the dividend (what’s being divided) and the second is the divisor (what we’re dividing by).\n",
    "\n",
    "The isOdd function is just the remainder of dividing by 2. A remainder of 0 is falsy, not odd, and a remainder of 1 is truthy, odd. We flipped the first and second parameters of modulo so that we could specify 2 as the divisor.\n",
    "\n",
    "The isEven function is just the complement of isOdd.\n",
    "\n",
    "The onlyOdd function is the filter function with the predicate (a function that returns a boolean) of isOdd. It’s waiting for the list of numbers, its final parameter, before it executes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The onlyEven function is a filter that uses isEven as its predicate.\n",
    "When we pass numbers to onlyEven and onlyOdd, isEven and isOdd get their final parameters and can finally execute returning the numbers we’d expect.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Javascript Shortcomings\n",
    "\n",
    "With all of the libraries and language enhancements that have gotten Javascript this far, it still suffers from the fact that it’s an Imperative Language that’s trying to be all things to all people.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most front end developers are stuck using Javascript in the browser because it’s been the only choice for so long. But many developers are now moving away from writing Javascript directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, they are writing in a different language and compiling, or more accurately, transpiling to Javascript.\n",
    "\n",
    "CoffeeScript was one of the first of these languages. And now, Typescript has been adopted by Angular 2. Babel can also be considered a transpiler for Javascript.\n",
    "\n",
    "More and more people are taking this approach in production.\n",
    "\n",
    "But these languages started with Javascript and only made it slightly better. Why not go all the way and transpile to Javascript from a Pure Functional Language?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Elm\n",
    "\n",
    "In this series, we’ve looked at Elm to help understand Functional Programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what is Elm? And how can I use it?\n",
    "\n",
    "Elm is a Pure Functional Language that compiles to Javascript so you can use it to create Web Applications using The Elm Architecture, aka TEA (this architecture inspired the developers of Redux).\n",
    "\n",
    "Elm programs do NOT have any Runtime Errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Elm is being used in production at companies such as NoRedInk, where Evan Czapliki the creator of Elm now works (he previously worked for Prezi).\n",
    "\n",
    "See this talk, 6 Months of Elm in Production, by Richard Feldman from NoRedInk and Elm evangelist for more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do I have to replace all of my Javascript with Elm?\n",
    "\n",
    "No. You can incrementally replace parts. See this blog entry, How to use Elm at Work, to learn more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why learn Elm?\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming in a Pure Functional Language is both limiting and freeing. It limits what you can do (mostly by keeping you from shooting yourself in the foot) but at the same time it frees you from bugs and bad design decisions since all Elm programs follow The Elm Architecture, a Functionally Reactive Model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functional Programming will make you a better programmer. The ideas in this article are only the tip of the iceberg. You really need to see them in practice to really appreciate how your programs will shrink in size and grow in stability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Javascript was initially built in 10 days and then patched for the last two decades to become a somewhat functional, somewhat object-oriented and a fully imperative programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Elm was designed using what has been learned in the last 30 years of work in the Haskell community, which draws from decades of work in mathematics and computer science.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Elm Architecture (TEA) was designed and refined over the years and is a result of Evan’s thesis in Functional \n",
    "Reactive Programming. Watch Controlling Time and Space to appreciate the level of thinking that went into the formulation of this design.\n",
    "\n",
    "Elm is designed for front-end web developers. It’s aimed at making their lives easier. Watch Let’s Be Mainstream to better understand this goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Future\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s impossible to know what the future will hold, but we can make some educated guesses. Here are some of mine:\n",
    "There will be a clear move toward languages that compile to Javascript.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Functional Programming ideas that have been around for over 40 years will be rediscovered to solve our current software complexity problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "The state of hardware, e.g. gigabytes of cheap memory and fast processors, will make functional techniques viable.\n",
    "CPUs will not get faster but the number of cores will continue to increase.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mutable state will be recognized as one of the biggest problems in complex systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "I wrote this series of articles because I believe that Functional Programming is the future and because I struggled over the last couple of years to learn it (I’m still learning).\n",
    "\n",
    "My goal is to help others learn these concepts easier and faster than I did and to help others become better programmers so that they can have more marketable careers in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if my prediction that Elm will be a huge language in the future is wrong, I can say with certainty that Functional Programming and Elm will be on the trajectory to whatever the future holds.\n",

    "#### The operator module\n",
    "The operator module was mentioned earlier. It contains a set of functions corresponding to Python’s operators. These functions are often useful in functional-style code because they save you from writing trivial functions that perform a single operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the functions in this module are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Math operations: add(), sub(), mul(), floordiv(), abs(), ...\n",
    "Logical operations: not_(), truth().\n",
    "Bitwise operations: and_(), or_(), invert().\n",
    "Comparisons: eq(), ne(), lt(), le(), gt(), and ge().\n",
    "Object identity: is_(), is_not().\n",
    "Consult the operator module’s documentation for a complete list.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Small functions and the lambda expression\n",
    "When writing functional-style programs, you’ll often need little functions that act as predicates or that combine elements in some way.\n",
    "\n",
    "If there’s a Python built-in or a module function that’s suitable, you don’t need to define a new function at all:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "stripped_lines = [line.strip() for line in lines]\n",
    "existing_files = filter(os.path.exists, file_list)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If the function you need doesn’t exist, you need to write it. One way to write small functions is to use the lambda statement. lambda takes a number of parameters and an expression combining these parameters, and creates an anonymous function that returns the value of the expression:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "adder = lambda x, y: x+y\n",
    "\n",
    "print_assign = lambda name, value: name + '=' + str(value)\n",
    "```\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Which alternative is preferable? That’s a style question; my usual course is to avoid using lambda.\n",
    "\n",
    "One reason for my preference is that lambda is quite limited in the functions it can define. The result has to be computable as a single expression, which means you can’t have multiway if... elif... else comparisons or try... except statements. If you try to do too much in a lambda statement, you’ll end up with an overly complicated expression that’s hard to read. Quick, what’s the following code doing?\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "import functools\n",

    "\n",
    "def combine(a, b):\n",
    "    return 0, a[1] + b[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "total = functools.reduce(combine, items)[1]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "```\n",
    "total = 0\n",
    "for a, b in items:\n",
    "    total += b\n",

    "```\n",
    "total = sum(b for a,b in items)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Many uses of functools.reduce() are clearer when written as for loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fredrik Lundh once suggested the following set of rules for refactoring uses of lambda:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Write a lambda function.\n",
    "- Write a comment explaining what the heck that lambda does.\n",
    "- Study the comment for a while, and think of a name that captures the essence of the comment.\n",
    "- Convert the lambda to a def statement, using that name.\n",
    "- Remove the comment.\n",
